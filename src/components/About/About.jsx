      <p>
        Iâ€™m a passionate front-end developer with a keen eye for design and a deep love for crafting seamless user experiences. With a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I thrive on transforming creative concepts into functional, interactive websites and applications. My focus is on creating responsive, accessible, and visually engaging interfaces that provide users with an intuitive experience, no matter the device.

          <h4>Design</h4>
          <p>
            My design approach is centered around simplicity and usability. I believe in the power of minimalistic design that not only looks good but also enhances user interaction. I work closely with designers to ensure that every pixel serves a purpose and aligns with the overall vision of the project.
